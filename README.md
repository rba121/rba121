# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rohit Bhardwaj  

I am an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at Simon Fraser University with a strong interest in embedded systems, FPGA development, and Edge AI. I am passionate about building real-time systems and exploring the intersection of hardware and software through co-design. I enjoy tackling challenging problems that require both low-level optimization and high-level system integration, and Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to learn and contribute to impactful technology projects.

## ðŸš€ Highlighted Projects
- ðŸŽ± **FPGA Pool Game** â€“ Real-time 8-ball pool simulation on ZedBoard with VGA graphics  
- ðŸ”¥ **HOTSPOT3D Acceleration** â€“ FPGA-based thermal modeling kernel optimization
